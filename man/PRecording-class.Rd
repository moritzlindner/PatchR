\title{(OK) S4 class storing imported ePhys Traces.}
\description{
\ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#stable}{\figure{lifecycle-stable.svg}{options: alt='[Stable]'}}}{\strong{[Stable]}} \cr
This class stores imported electrophysiology Traces. Currently only import procedures for HEKA's PatchMaster are implemented. It has some strict validitiy checks implemented to assure data consistency.

\details{
\describe{
\item{Traces}{Character vector containing names of the Traces (=Monitors) imported form the dat file and any subsequently computed Trace. Computed Traces have the same dimensions as imported}

\item{Units}{Character vector containing the SI units for data stored in corresponding Trace. Order as in Traces.}

\item{TimeTrace}{Numeric vector containing the time points of the recording.}

\item{Sweeps}{Ordered vector containing the names of the sweeps.}

\item{SweepTimes}{Numeric vector containing start times corresponding to Sweeps}

\item{Data}{List of matrices. One list item per Trace. Matrix rows correspond to TimeTrace, columns to Sweeps}

\item{Plots}{List that can contain any ggplot derived from the data. List item names that equal Traces are reserved.}

\item{MetaData}{matrix that can contain additional per-sweep Metadata. Per-time Metadata can be stored in the Data slot using the \link[=AddTrace]{AddTrace} method.}

\item{RecordingParams}{An item of class PRecordingParams containing recording parameters for that trace.}
